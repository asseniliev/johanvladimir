This module uses a new core library that allows you to choose images from
an image gallery.

For it to work, you will have to move the included file ImgLibrary.php to
directory "/core", file "Image_Library.txt" to directory /docs/developers
and files ImgLibrary_view_gallery.tpl & ImgLibrary_view_gallery.tpl to
directory "/templates".
