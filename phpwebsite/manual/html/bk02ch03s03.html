    the Calendar administration panel. You will come to the event form. Here
    is what you will need to fill out.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Active</b></span> - This defaults to 'On'. If you want
    the event to be hidden from user view until later, change this to
    'Off'.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Title</b></span>
    - Pretty self-explanatory. This is the title of the event. Keep it short
    and don't include the date or time. Let the rest of the form handle
    that.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Description</b></span>
    - Although not required, you should fill this in with a description of the
    event and its importance.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Image</b></span> - You can upload an image to be associated
    with your event. Just click the Browse button and choose an image from
    your hard drive. You can also use an image that is already on the server
    by picking it from the drop down menu. Set your selection to
    &lt;None&gt; if you decide you don't want an image with your event.
    Finally, select an image and click the Remove Button to delete the image
    file from the server.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Template</b></span> - The template controls the layout of your
    event when it is viewed. Normally, the default.tpl template is sufficient.
    If however, there is another template file you wish to use, select it from
    the drop down menu.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Event
    Type</b></span> - There are four event types. Click the radio buttonnext
    to the one you wish to use.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Interval</b></span> - This event has a definite start and end
    time and date.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Starts
    At</b></span> - This event has a definite start time but an undetermined
    end time.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Deadline</b></span>
    - The start time of this event is irrelevant but the end time is vital.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>All Day</b></span> - This event doesn't have a start or
    end time (e.g. a holiday).</p></li></ol></div></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Start Time</b></span> - This is the time the event starts. You
    do not need to set this for the All Day or Deadline event type.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>End Time</b></span> - This is the time the event ends. You
    should set this for Interval and Deadline events, but not for Starts At or
    All Day events.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Start
    Date</b></span> - The date the event starts. Note that the Start Date must
    always be before the End Date.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>End Date</b></span> - The date the event ends. Normally this
    is the same day as the Start Date, however you can create an Interval
    event that takes place over several days.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Categories</b></span> - If you have created categories in
    FatCat, you can associate the event to one or more of them. If your event
    is important, consider clicking the Sticky check box. This will assure it
    is seen in the What's Related box.</p></li></ul></div><p>Click the <span class="bold"><b>Create Event</b></span> button once
    you have finished filling out the form. If there aren't any errors,
    your event should now appear on the calendar.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="bk02ch03s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="bk02ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="bk02ch03s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Getting Started </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Editing Events</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
