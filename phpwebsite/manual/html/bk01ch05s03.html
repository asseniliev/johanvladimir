    site. Fortunately, you probably won't have to alter the data here very
    often.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2819672"/>Change Page Title</h3></div></div><div/></div><p>If you have your browser open, look at the very top of the browser
      window. You should see something like the following:
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Title of Website - Name of Browser</em></span>. phpWebSite
      ships with the page title set to, what else, phpWebSite. You should
      change that. Determine the name of your site and type it in to the text
      field next to the <span class="bold"><b>Change Page Title</b></span>
      button.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2887129"/>Edit Meta Tags</h3></div></div><div/></div><p>The Internet has several search engines. Some of the ones you
      probably heard of are Google, Yahoo, Altavista, and Ask Jeeves. Each of
      the engines wants a quick way to get information about your site. Here
      is where meta tags come in. Choose one of the meta tags you wish to edit
      and click the <span class="bold"><b>Edit Metatags</b></span> button.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Keywords</b></span> - Marvelous. Informative. Great. These
      are words that may describe your web site. However, what you want to put
      here are words that describe the content of your site, not how you feel
      about it. Enter words you believe someone may type into a search engine
      and see your site listed. If you have a web site about board games, you
      could have a list like this:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>board games, monopoly,
      sorry, Milton Bradley, twister, Risk </p></blockquote></div><p>Put
      in as many words as you can think of that relate to what your site
      addresses. Do not put words that don't relate to your site just to
      get lost web surfers. It irritates people. </p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Description</b></span> - Here you want to have a short (read
      that again: short) description of your site. Summarize all the great
      things your site provides within about 260 characters. Some search
      engines display this information when a match to your site is found.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Robots</b></span> - When a search engine comes to your page,
      it will (sometimes) ask permission before it records it. Robots are your
      traffic guards. They tell the search engine whether to record this page
      (or <span class="bold"><b>index</b></span>) or not and whether it can
      <span class="bold"><b>follow</b></span> links on your page or not. You
      have four options:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p><span class="bold"><b>all</b></span> - This tells the engine that they may index
      your site and continue down all the links on your page.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>none</b></span> - The engine is told to leave you alone:
      don't index the site and don't follow any links. You may prefer
      this if you are running a private site.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>index, nofollow</b></span> - The engine can index the page
      but shouldn't follow any links.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>noindex, follow</b></span> - The engine should not index the
      page, but may follow your links.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>This option is currently
      useless. Currently Layout reports these robots on every page. The engine
      goes down your link path but is not allowed to index any of the
      resultant pages. This will change in 0.9.3.</p></div></li></ul></div></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Author</b></span> - This is your name or the name of the
      main content person. Not really required.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Owner</b></span> - This is usually the email address of the
      person responsible for the site. Beware filling this out however as
      there are evil, nasty, horrible, people who steal these addresses to
      send you their useless spam email (not that I am bitter). If you wish to
      fill it out, consider entering your email address in a form that is hard
      to parse by the spam degenerates. For example, I might use: matt at
      hotmail dot com instead of matt@hotmail.com.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><b>Content Type</b></span> - This reports the character sets
      your site is using. Just let this sit at ISO-8859-1 unless you know it
      should be otherwise.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2887114"/>Reinitialize Default Theme</h3></div></div><div/></div><p>You can try clicking on this button if your boxes have become
      scrambled. It will try to recreate the default layout for the theme you
      are currently using. Be careful as some modules add boxes outside of
      their defaults. If that is the case you might have to go to that module
      and update the data to have it remake the box.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2887506"/>Refresh Boxes</h3></div></div><div/></div><p>Click this button to purge the database of old box files that
      aren't supported anymore. This should be run if you remove a theme
      from your server directory.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2887527"/>User can change theme</h3></div></div><div/></div><p>If you have several themes installed on your site, you may want to
      give the users the ability to change which one they see. This can come
      in handy, for example, if you have a color blind or text only theme. If
      you change this to off, users won't be able to change the theme.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="bk01ch05s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="bk01ch05.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="bk01ch05s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Getting Started </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Layout Panel</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
