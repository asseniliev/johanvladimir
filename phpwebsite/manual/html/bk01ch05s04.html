    the top of the page. This panel follows you around until you close it. The
    Layout panel lets you control the type and position of the boxes in your
    theme. It also lets you control which theme your site uses.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2887573"/>Move Boxes</h3></div></div><div/></div><p>If you don't like the position of a box on your page, you can
      change it by click the <span class="bold"><b>On</b></span> link. After
      you do this, you will see a series of arrows on the top left corner and
      bottom right corner of each box. These are what you will click to move
      the boxes.</p><p>Before trying this however, lets talk about the structure of your
      page. Theme layouts are arranged in quadrants. The quadrants are
      (usually) in a ticktacktoe pattern. Each quadrant is a theme variable.</p><p>Now if you look next to the arrows you will see a series of
      numbers separated with colons, like so: 2:1:2. The first number in our
      code is the column. The second number is the row. The third number is
      the queue order.</p><p>We will get to the third number in a moment, but first lets look
      at the first two numbers. Here are out quadrant codes with the default
      theme variables in parenthesises:</p><div class="table"><a id="id2887622"/><p class="title"><b>Table 5.1. Layout example</b></p><table summary="Layout example" border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>1:1 (left_col_top)</td><td>2:1 (top)</td><td>3:1
      (right_col_top)</td></tr><tr><td>1:2 (left_col_mid)</td><td>2:2
      (body)</td><td>3:2 (right_col_mid)</td></tr><tr><td>1:3
      (left_col_bottom)</td><td>2:3 (bottom)</td><td>3:3
      (right_col_bottom)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>So if we look at our example above (2:1:2) we can see that a box
      with this number is in the second column, first row.</p><p>Now lets look at the third number. That is the box queue. Each
      quadrant can hold several boxes. These boxes need to be ordered as well.
      So using the code, we would know that the box is in the second (2) queue
      position. This means there is one box above the 2:1:2 box. This does not
      mean you will always see that box however. The visibility of a box
      depends upon what module is running, what page is being visited and
      other factors.</p><p>Now back to box moving. Let's look at the top left series of
      arrows. The first one is a single up arrow. If I click it, that box will
      move up in the queue. Our 2:1:2 box would then be 2:1:1. Since our box
      would be at the top the queue, clicking the single arrow again would
      send it to the next row. Since 2:1:1 is the top row, this would actually
      wrap the box to the bottom row. So 2:1:1 would now be 2:3:5. Why is the
      last number five? Because there are already four other boxes in that
      quadrant. The single down arrow in the lower right corner of the box
      does exactly the opposite.</p><p>The next arrow at the top left is a single arrow pointing to the
      left. This sends the box to the left. So our 2:3:5 box would then be in
      quadrant 1:3:7. Anytime a box is sent to a new quadrant, it is placed at
      the end of the box queue. The single right arrow in the lower right
      corner moves the box to the right.</p><p>Finally you will notice the double arrow pointing up or down.
      Clicking this tells Layout to send the box to the front or bottom of the
      queue line. So if our box is in the 1:3:7 position and I click the
      double up arrow, it will be transferred to the 1:3:1 position. Clicking
      the double down arrow would send it where? That is correct! To the 1:1:5
      position. Why? Because the 1:3:7 is the end of the queue. Remember when
      we moved it from the right? Since it is at the end of the queue it would
      wrap from the bottom back to the top quadrant. Since it is in a new
      quadrant, it is put at the bottom of the queue.</p><p>Confused yet? It will make more sense when you start clicking on
      the arrows. Click on the <span class="bold"><b>Off</b></span> link when
      you are done.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2887753"/>Change Box Style</h3></div></div><div/></div><p>Just as there are many boxes that make up a theme, there can also
      be several different box styles included with it. After you click the
      <span class="bold"><b>On</b></span> link, a drop down box will appear
      under each box. Pick the box style you wish to use and click set. The
      box will then change to the new style. Click the <span class="bold"><b>Off</b></span>
      link when you are finished.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>This is why the panel follows you
      around until it is closed. You might need to maneuver to a specific page
      before you can change a box style or position.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2887793"/>Set Default Theme</h3></div></div><div/></div><p>Your default theme is what users see when they first come to the
      site. If you allow users to pick their own theme, that user (and only
      that user) will see their theme when they log in. You can change your
      default theme by choosing one from the drop down menu and clicking the
      button.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2887811"/>Settings and Close Panel</h3></div></div><div/></div><p>The <span class="bold"><b>Settings</b></span> link takes you back
