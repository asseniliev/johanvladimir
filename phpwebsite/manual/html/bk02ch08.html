  is a module used to create online forms and collect data from your site
  visitors through these forms. Once data has been collected, Form Generator
  allows you to export the data into a tab delimited file. This allows you to
  import your data into a spreadsheet program such OpenOffice.org Calc or
  Microsoft Excel. Form Generator also offers some basic reporting features of
  it's own, but they are limited.</p><p>Some helpful things to
  remember when using the form generator:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Main Menu</em></span> is always
  shown across the top while administrating the Form Generator module. This
  menu allows you to perform key operations in certain areas of the Form
  Generator. Some of these operations include: New Form, List Forms, Settings,
  Report, and Archive.</p></li><li><p>When first entering the Form
  Generator the Main Menu will only show two options: <span class="emphasis"><em>New Form
  </em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>List Forms</em></span>. The Menu will expand
  it's options when a form has been selected from one of the lists of
  forms. Certain options are shown for saved forms and certain options shown
  for unsaved or unapproved forms.</p></li><li><p>There are two parts to
  forms. <span class="emphasis"><em>Settings</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Elements</em></span>. A
  form's settings can be altered at any time in any form. They include
  settings like your instructions for the form, the submission message shown
  upon successful submission of a form, whether or not only registered users
  can view the form, and whether or not the form can be filled out multiple
  times by your users. A form's elements are the actual
  &quot;questions&quot; within your form. The elements are selected from a list
  of HTML elements like text field, text area, drop box, check box, radio
  button, and multi select. These elements can be used to ask and gather all
  sorts of information. A form's elements can only be edited when a form
  is in the unsaved state.</p></li><li><p>Under <span class="emphasis"><em>List Forms</em></span>,
  three separate lists are shown. <span class="emphasis"><em>Saved Forms</em></span> are forms
  that have been saved and may or may not contain data. That depends on
  whether or not you have the form available to your site visitors and whether
  or not those visitors have filled out the form. <span class="emphasis"><em>Unsaved Forms</em></span>
  are forms that are being built but haven't been fully saved.
  <span class="emphasis"><em>Unapproved Forms</em></span> are forms that were created by a user
  that is designated as needing approval of their forms before they are made
  available to the public. Once an unsaved or unapproved form is saved, it
  will move to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Saved Forms</em></span> list.</p></li><li><p>When
  clicking on a form in a list, you will be viewing the form as a visitor to
  your site would view it. However, as an admin you will see the
  <span class="emphasis"><em>Main Menu</em></span> at the top. From the menu you can select to
  perform various operations on the form you are viewing. You can always
  return to the form listing by clicking <span class="emphasis"><em>List Forms</em></span>.</p></li><li><p>Something
  to keep in mind when saving forms: Make sure you are positive the form is
  correct and ready to be viewed and filled out by your site visitors. Once a
  form is saved it will start collecting data. If you decide to edit the
  elements within that form, the data collected by the form must be
  <span class="emphasis"><em>cleared and archived </em></span>. Hence, you reset the form when
  you edit it's elements. A good practice is to export the data from the
  form just before you edit it's elements. You can always edit a
  form's settings no matter which state it is in.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="bk02ch07s05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="bk02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="bk02ch08s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Hiding or Showing an Existing File </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Creating a Form</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
