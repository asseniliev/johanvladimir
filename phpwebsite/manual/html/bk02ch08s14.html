  available for saved forms since they are the only forms that could possibly
  contain data. There are a couple of ways to report on data entered into a
  form. Form Generator has a built in method for browsing current entries in a
  form as well as a method for exporting this data into a tab delimited file
  that can be downloaded and imported into any spread sheet program (e.g.:
  OpenOffice.org Calc, Microsoft Excel, etc.).</p><p>First, to enter
  into reporting mode for a form, follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Make
  sure you are logged into an administrative account that has permissions to
  use the Form Generator.</p></li><li><p>From your
  <span class="emphasis"><em>Control Panel</em></span>, select the <span class="emphasis"><em>Site Content</em></span>
  tab.</p></li><li><p>Find and select the
  <span class="emphasis"><em>Form Generator</em></span> module.</p></li><li><p>You
  will be shown a list of your current forms.</p></li><li><p>Find
  the form you wish to report on and click it's <span class="emphasis"><em>Name</em></span>.</p></li><li><p>You
  will now see a <span class="emphasis"><em>Report</em></span> option available on the
  <span class="emphasis"><em>Main Menu</em></span>. Click <span class="emphasis"><em>Report</em></span>.</p></li><li><p>You
  are now in report mode for the form.</p></li></ol></div><p>Some
  statistical data is calculated and displayed by Form Generator such as the
  number of complete and incomplete entries, the total number of entries, and
  the date and time of the last entry the form received. Shown below this
  information is a list of the actual entries received by the form. There are
  several options you have available for each entry. You can edit, delete,
  view, or print each entry.</p><p>When editing an entry, the form is
  loaded with the data populated, and you are allowed to change any value you
  wish. When viewing or printing an entry, just the raw data is shown and not
  the form in it's entirety. If you delete an entry, it is permanently
  removed from the form's data and can only be recovered through an
  archive if one exists. It is recommended you archive your form data before
  you edit or remove any of it's entries. This will ensure you have a
  backup copy in case of emergency.</p><p>To export all the data within
  the form, simply click the Export button. A archived &quot;.zip&quot; file
  will be created by the Form Generator and will be sent to you through your
  browser. Choose a suitable download location on your machine and save the
  file. To unzip the file you can use the unzip command in *nix or the winzip,
  winace, or winrar programs in a windows environment. A single file will be
  extracted that is a tab delimited file containing your form's data.
  Using a spread sheet program, import the file and then save it to a more
  workable format that is native to the program you're using (i.e.: *.sxc
  for OpenOffice.org Calc or *.xls for Microsoft Excel).</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="bk02ch08s13.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="bk02ch08.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="bk02ch09.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Archiving a Form </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 9. Photo Albums</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
