This is a skeleton set of files for enabling server side
content-type and charset. It is useful for debugging module
and theme xml well-formed issues.

Content will be served to xml capable browsers as
application/xhtml+xml, while non xml capable clients will
receive text/html. W3C's validator will work against the
else doctype.


INSTALLATION:

language, stylesheet, and meta information.
Copy theme.php to your theme directory, and modify these files:

     define("ALLOW_THEME_PHP_INSERTION", TRUE);
