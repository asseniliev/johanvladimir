phpWebSite allows you to upgrade individual modules in the Boost module.
However, when there are changes in the core modules (like in 0.9.1 to 0.9.2)
which prevent you from even getting to Boost, you will need to run the
upgrader from outside of phpWebSite.



Getting ready to upgrade
--------------------------------------
Hopefully you have NOT untarred the upgrade into your phpWebSite directory
just yet. The reason will be apparent when you try to hit the site: you 
will get error messages.

To prepare yourself for an upgrade you should:
 o Dump/backup your hub and branch databases
 o Backup your hub and branch directories and files
 o Create a index.php file that warns the users you are administrating the site.
   See the end of this document for more information.
 o Close and restart your browser. If you have a session live while updating your
   site, it MIGHT interfere with the upgrade process. If you are using Boost
   to upgrade, you can skip this step.

If you are upgrading to 0.9.3 or greater you should make the image directory
and subdirectories of images writable by the web server.  

A quick command to do this is:  chmod -R o+rwx images

If the images/mod/controlpanel directory does not have the correct permissions
then the control panel icons will not be copied correctly.


Prepare your branches if you are running any off of your hub site.
Depending on the owner of these directories will affect the commands to run.
The base dir of each branch will need to be writable:

If the owner is the webserver and you have root access
chmod o+rwx branch1/
chmod o+rwx branch2/
etc...

otherwise
chmod 777 branch1/
chmod 777 branch2/
etc...

The images and themes directories will also need to be writable for the
upgrade:

chmod -R o+rwx branch1/images/
chmod -R o+rwx branch1/themes/
chmod -R o+rwx branch2/images/
chmod -R o+rwx branch2/themes/

or

chmod -R 777 branch1/images/
chmod -R 777 branch1/themes/
chmod -R 777 branch2/images/
chmod -R 777 branch2/themes/

If the webserver is not given proper permissions then branch upgrades will not
be successful.


Once you have you have finished these steps (and ONLY after) should you
continue.


Running the Upgrade
--------------------------------------
Now you can untar the new files into your installation. If you go to
your site's index.php file, you will see a few error messages. The
aforementioned index.php prevents most people from seeing these messages.
Point your browser to 'http://www.myWebSitesName.com/setup/' where 
'www.myWebSitesName.com' is the address for your web site.

The first thing the upgrader will do is upgrade your core modules. It
will also check to see if you are running any branch sites and automatically
upgrade them as well.

You should receive a 'Core Updated!' message. Underneath these messages
will be a list of modules that appear to need upgrading as well. Click
the checkboxes of the modules you want updated (or click the 'Check All' button
to check all of them) and click the 'Update Modules' button. Your site and
all your branch sites should now be updated.

If you made a warning index.php file, dump it and put the real file back.
You should now be able to use your site as normal.


Should something go wrong
--------------------------------------
If you go to your site and receive errors the FIRST thing you should try
is closing your browser, reopening it, and trying to use your site again.
Sometimes old sessions will conflict with the upgraded information.

If you get an error message or your sites still don't function, restore your
backed up databases and files and try again. If it STILL doesn't work, contact
us via Sourceforge, we want to know what went wrong.

Please include your OS, web server, PHP, and phpWebSite version information.
Also include any error messages that were displayed. The more data you supply
us, the better chance you will receive help.

You may also try using the repair.php file. It contains answers to a few
commonly experienced problems.



Returning to update.php
---------------------------------------
Most of the time, Boost will handle your upgrade needs. However, should 
an upgraded module cause problems before you can get to the Boost module,
you can always return to update.php to upgrade the offending module.

  
Securing your Site
---------------------------------------
Although setup.php, update.php, and repair.php require passwords to enter,
you may want to prevent malicious users (read: jerks) from even accessing
these files. One way would be to limit read access on that directory after
you are finished using it. Another measure would be to alter your 
allow_setup.php file. Open this file in an editor and change the 'TRUE'
to 'FALSE' like so:

$_SESSION['allow_setup'] = FALSE;

Change this back to TRUE when you need to update again.




Appendix I: index.php File Example
--------------------------------------

While you are administrating your site, you may want to put a friendly
message to warn your users. This will prevent them from seeing error messages
until you are ready to present the upgraded site to them.

You should prepare this file before upgrading your site, but you SHOULD NOT
put it in the hub directory until after untarring the code. If you do, then
it will get overwritten by the new file.

If you are confused just do the following
1) Create a file named 'index.php' in a directory outside your installation.
2) Type something like the below into the file:

<--------------------- BEGIN cutting after this line -------------------------->
<?php

echo "<div align=\"center\"><h1>Please be patient while we upgrade the site.</h1>
We'll be back in a jiffy!</div>";

?>
<-------------------- STOP cutting before this line --------------------------->

3) Save this file.
4) Now untar the upgrade.
5) Make a copy of the 'index.php' file in the installation directory. Give it different
   name (eg. mv index.php runme.php ). Don't lose this file. Note: You can also
   change the extension but this won't allow you to test the upgrade. 
6) Copy the index.php file YOU created above into the installation directory.

Now, when people hit your site, they will get a message that the site is undergoing
upgrades.

After you upgrade the site you can test it by going to your backed up file.
(e.g. http://www.myWebSite.com/runme.php). You won't be able to get too far into
the site however as the modules expect to return to the real 'index.php' file.
If it appears to work (no error messages) then you can delete your maintenance
file and rename your backup file (e.g. runme.php) to 'index.php'.

If the above is still confusing, then just let your users see the error messages
until you are finished upgrading. They'll live :)
